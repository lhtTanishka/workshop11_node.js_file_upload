This Node.js project provides a simple yet powerful file handling API using Express.js and Multer. It allows users to upload, delete, and rename image files (only JPEG and PNG formats) via RESTful endpoints. The upload endpoint (PUT /upload) restricts files to a maximum size of 1MB and stores them with a unique UUID as their filename for security and traceability. Uploaded files are saved to a dedicated uploads folder on the server. The delete endpoint (DELETE /delete-file/:id) allows removal of files based on their unique ID, while the rename endpoint (POST /rename-file) lets users rename files by supplying the file ID and a new name. This backend is ideal for applications that require simple file management with basic validation and operations, making it a great boilerplate for web applications, admin panels, and content upload systems.
